### Project: TutorMate

TutorMate helps private tuition teachers manage their students more easily. Faster access and store of studentsâ€™ contacts and data, provides better time management and productivity. The app will help to manage students for a single tuition teacher only. The app will only provide simple student analytics (without detailed student progress analysis).
