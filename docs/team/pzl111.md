### Project: TutorMate

TutorMate helps private tuition teachers manage their students more easily. Faster access and store of studentsâ€™ contacts and data, provides better time management and productivity. The app will help to manage students for a single tuition teacher only. The app will only provide simple student analytics (without detailed student progress analysis).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: List command to toggle between different lists (Pull request [#56](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/56))
  * What it does: Allows the user to toggle between the different lists corresponding to different states.
  * Justification: Each state has their corresponding pair of lists, hence this feature allows the user to switch between them easily.
  * Highlights: This also builds upon another feature which allows for conditional display of student details in the student list.
* **New Feature**: State system for app model (Pull request [#68](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/68))
  * What it does: Changes the app to work in 3 different states, where the `STUDENTS` state handles students information, `SCHEDULE` state handles lesson and scheduling, `TASKS` state handles tasks related purposes.
  * Justification: Our app purpose allowed for student detail management, tutor lesson handling and tasks management. Consequently, each purpose had different UI and command behaviour. Hence, we needed a way to separate each purpose.
  * Highlights: This feature heavily impacts the workflow for the user, since it implies the app having 3 different states or "modes" with differing purposes.
* **New Feature**: Student remarks (Pull request [#83](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/83))
  * What it does: Allows tracking of remarks for each student.
  * Justification: There are certain small information for each student that tutors want to remember, that does not belong to a specific category, such as remembering a weak area for a student.
  * Highlights: Remarks allow for flexibility in storing any type of information in text form, giving rise to many applications depending on the tutor's creativity.
* **New Feature**: Command history tracking (Pull request [#169](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/169))
  * What it does: Stores a history of the commands typed during the session, to reuse previously typed commands.
  * Justification: Repeated commands or similar commands have to be retyped or deliberately copy-pasted, which is tedious and has poor usability. Hence, this feature allows the user to quickly retrieve the previous commands entered to re-execute or make minor changes to the command for another execution.
  * Highlights: Increased efficiency in executing similar (long) commands, by simply pressing the arrow keys to retrieve previous commands and making minor changes, rather than copy-pasting or re-typing the entire command.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme to fit Figma sketch (Pull request [#56](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/56))
  * UI re-design to accommodate a 2-panel layout (Pull request [#68](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/68))
  * Modified the implementation of `find` command, such that it searches using a search string, rather than space-separated keywords which is not intuitive. Also extended find command to work with both students and lessons. (Pull request [#108](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/108), [#132](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/132))
  * Created an alternative theme for the app with larger scaling, used during product demo to aid readability. (Pull request [#134](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/134), [#154](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/154))

* **Contributions to User Guide**:
  * List feature update (Pull request [#183](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/183))

* **Contributions to Developer Guide**:
  * List feature update (Pull request [#100](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/100))
  * State and remark in ModelClassDiagram (Pull request [#100](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/100))

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
  * tP Team Organization Setup
  * tP Team Repo Setup
  * Sketched alternative UI design to use for app

* **Review/mentoring contributions**:
  * 25 PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments)
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams

* **Contributions beyond the project team**:
  * to be added soon
