### Project: TutorMate

TutorMate helps private tuition teachers manage their students more easily. Faster access and store of studentsâ€™ contacts and data, provides better time management and productivity. The app will help to manage students for a single tuition teacher only. The app will only provide simple student analytics (without detailed student progress analysis).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete tasks in the task list of lesson.
  * What it does: allows the user to add task with a description to a lesson in the schedule.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can keep track of the tasks to complete in preparation for tuition lessons.
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as a lesson has to be shown before deleting any tasks and task list can only be changed through a lesson which adds complexity to the code.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the abilty to indicate subjects taught to each student.
  * What it does: allows the user to add subjects that they are tutoring for each student.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as users can track which subjects they are teaching each student.
  * Highlights: The implementation was tedious as it required changes to add and edit commands of student.
