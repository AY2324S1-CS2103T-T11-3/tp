# TutorMate User Guide
<br>

## About

TutorMate is a desktop app targeted to private tuition teachers on handling tuition related matters.

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, TutorMate can get your administrative tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This document describes the main features of TutorMate:
1. Student Management System: track all student details
2. Lesson Schedule: easily plan and manage lessons
3. Task Lists: keep track of tasks to be done for lessons

With a customised student list and schedule in TutorMate just for you, organising lessons and managing students
will be the least of your worries.

This project is based on the [AddressBook-Level3 project](https://se-education.org).

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer. You can check by opening a command terminal and typing `java -version`.

1. Download the latest `tutormate.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TutorMate.

1. Open a command terminal, navigate into the folder you put the jar file in using the change directory command `cd`, and use the `java -jar tutormate.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/about.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list students` : Lists all students with their name.

    * In list `STUDENTS`:

        * `add -name Leah` : Adds a student named "Leah" to the application.

        * `show 3` : Shows the details of the person with the index 3 in TutorMate.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.
2. Refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) below for the summary of all commands.
2. Refer to the [Glossary](#glossary) below for definitions of glossary terms.

## Important notes

### Basic usage
* The app is split into 3 states: student list, schedule list and task list. Each corresponds to the main features of TutorMate.
* Each state has its associated features, while certain features work with all states but has differing functionalities.
* The student list handles student details management, schedule list handles lessons and scheduling, task list handles tasks.
* The GUI has several main components (see GUI image below):
  * The command box is for users to enter and execute commands.
  * The response box is to display responses for command execution, to indicate success or errors.
  * The left side has the list panel, which shows different list types (student, schedule, tasks).
  * The right side has the details panel, which shows details of any specific item in the list.

### Terminologies / Symbols
* Flag: denoted with a dash before the flag name e.g. -name.
* Text formatted as code snippets are either commands e.g. `list SCHEDULE`, command formats e.g. `list [LIST][KEYWORDS]` or parameters e.g. `NAME`.
* <box type="info" seamless>This box denotes additional information.</box>
* <box type="tip" seamless>This box denotes tips to improve usability.</box>
* <box type="warning" seamless>This box denotes warnings that can cause errors.</box>
* ```This box denotes command outputs.```

### Notes on command format
<box type="info" seamless>

* Words in upper case are compulsory parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add -name NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add -name Leah`.
  In this case, "Leah" is substituted for `NAME`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `list [LIST] [KEYWORDS]` can be used as `list` or as `list students email`.

* Flags can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-name NAME -phone PHONE_NUMBER`, `-phone PHONE_NUMBER -name NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command entered is `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TutorMate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
